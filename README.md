# Clean Architecture Chat

This is an iOS application sample built with the [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). This application doesn't use any libraries or frameworks to make it simple and easy to understand for everyone.

## How To Try

This application uses Twitter OAuth to get Twitter followers. If you want to try, replace OAuth [parameters](https://github.com/torufuruya/CleanArchitectureChat/blob/master/CleanArchitectureChat/Classes/DataStore/TwitterRequestManager.swift#L28-L29) with your app's one.
